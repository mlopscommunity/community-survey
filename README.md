# Overview
**Document status:** Working draft

Our goal is to create a survey that helps us, data science & MLOps practitioners, learn more about our community and (in the future) track how our community changes year-over-year.  Said differently - this is a survey for the community, by the community.  We designed this survey to gain an accurate understanding of we, the professionals designing, building and deploying **production** ML systems, individually and collectively are, the types of data and models we implement, the tools we use, and the challenges we face.  Specifically, this is NOT a vendor-led survey that pushes forward a specific perspective that advantages a vendor or group of vendors.

This document provides an outline of the topics we want to understand from our community.  It is intended to spark discussion and drive alignment on set of topics and learning goals within each topic.

# Objectives & goals

Specifically, our goals are:
* Develop a ~10 minute survey that provides a neutral, vendor-agnostic view of _who_ is in our community and _why and how_ MLOps is applied.
* Publish an annual report on the `State of MLOps` based on the survey results
* Survey 1,000 data science practitioners who are representative of the broader community (per year)
* Provide open-source access to the (anonymized) data
